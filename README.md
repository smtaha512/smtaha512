# Hi, I'm Taha — Senior Backend Engineer for Product-Focused Startups

I help fast-moving teams build, scale, and ship backend systems with clean, maintainable code.

- 🔧 9 years in backend & cloud (Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, AWS)
- 🚀 Worked on B2B SaaS platforms, event-driven systems, and multi-region infrastructure
- 🤝 Collaborated closely with product managers and founders — async, autonomous, and reliable
- 🌍 Open to freelance, consulting, or full/part-time backend roles (remote only)

## ✅ How I Can Help

I’m best at:

- **Building MVPs fast** — from blank repo to live in 4-6 weeks
- **Cleaning up legacy systems** — refactor, modularize, containerize
- **Scaling backends** — queues, observability, rate limits, cloud infra
- **Owning slices of the product** — APIs, auth, deployment, team onboarding

Need someone who quietly delivers and doesn’t need handholding? That’s me.
